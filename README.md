# CipherText v2.4
Cipher and Decipher Text using JavaFX 

Requirements: Any Desktop Operating System which has the support of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and JDK (Java Development Kit) when editing these files. 

<h1>Note<h1>

The initial purpose of this project was to allow the user to cipher and decipher text.This Application 'CipherText' was created in JavaFX using 'IntelliJ IDEA' therefore when editing these files, you could use 'IntelliJ IDEA' to import the project folder or simply use your faviourte text editor - the java files can be found in the <b>/src/</b> folder. All code is open-source, but a reference to 'Milan Conhye' would be much appreciated. This program does not use the back bone of ciphering and deciphering text, instead uses the "javax.crypto" library to generate and securly encrypt and decrypt information. All code has been thoroughly commented in order to be understood and further extended.

It is recommended to install the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files" - instructions can be found [here](http://suhothayan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/how-to-install-java-cryptography.html). This would allow you to use the stronger security to encrypt and decrypt files. However, if you are unable to install this, an enabler of this extention has been enabled within the main method of this program.
